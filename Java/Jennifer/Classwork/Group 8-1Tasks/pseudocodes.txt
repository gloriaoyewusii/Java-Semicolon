pseudocodes

1. find the maximum of four numbers using logical operators

collect and store four numbers as number1, number2, number3, number4.
using the logical && operator, if number1 is greater than all the other numbers, then it is the maximum number.
if number2 is greater than the remaining numbers, it is the maximum number.
if number3 is greater than the remaining numbers, it is the maximum number.
if number4 is greater than the remaining numbers, it is the maximum number.
Display the maximum number.


2. Write a Java program to find the grade of a student based on their marks and attendance.

Create two variables for attendance marks and store as attendanceMarks
create another variable for student marks and store as studentMarks
create a variable for total score of students and store as totalScore
sum up attendance marks and student marks using: attendanceMarks + studentMarks
calculate the sum and display as totalScore
Create a variable for grade called studentGrade

if studentGrade is 0 - 39, student grade is F
if studentGrade is 40 - 49 student grade is E
if studentGrade is 50 - 59, student grade is D
if studentGrade is 60 - 69, student grade is C
if studentGrade is 70 - 79, student grade is B
if studentGrade is 80 - 89, student grade is A
if studentGrade is 90 - 100, student grade is A+
Display the grade of the student as studentGrade.

3. 
Write a program that utilizes a while loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to 5.

create a variable named number and initialize to 1.
using the while loop, constrain number to less than or equal to 5.
calculate the square of numbers using: square = number * number.
Display square.


4. Write an application that uses a for loop in
it’s normal structure and in the structure
similar to while loops.

create and initialize a variable named as number to 1.
create another variable and store as square.
using the for loop, constrain number to less than or equal to 5.
calculate the square of numbers using: square = number * number.
Display square.



For the while loop.
create a variable named number and initialize to 1.
using the while loop, constrain number to less than or equal to 5.
calculate the square of numbers using: square = number * number.
Display square.


5.initialise a variable named number to 1.
iniitialise another variable named square to 0;
calculate square using: number * number
calculate cube using square * number
display number
display square
display cube



using a for loop, create a counter variable and initialize to 1.
create a range or loop continuation condition where counter is less than 10
increment counter by adding 3 to its value.
using another for loop, create another variable named number and initialize to counter
create a range or loop continuation condition where number is less than counter plus 2.
increment by adding 1 to its value.
print a line to add space
Display number
